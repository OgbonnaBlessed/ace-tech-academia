## Git Setup and Version Control Workflow
### Repository Structure
Organized for clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and shared resources.

### Branching Strategy:
- **main**: Stable production-ready code.
- **develop**: Integration of new features before merging into main.
- **feature/branch-name**: Dedicated branches for individual feature development.

### Workflow:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
2. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/branch-name
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added feature description"
4. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/branch-name
5. Open a pull request (PR) for review before merging into develop
